              Here at Dog dojo we offer a 6 week course for puppies aged between
              12 and 20 weeks. We provide a safe and fun environment for your
              puppy to learn and socialise with other puppies. The course is
              designed to help your puppy learn basic commands, socialisation
              skills, and good manners. Our experienced trainers will guide you
              and your puppy through each session, providing you with the tools
              and knowledge you need to continue your puppy's training at home.

              We require all our puppies to be fully vaccinated and have had a
              worming treatment to prevent cross infection between puppies. This
              is to ensure the safety of all puppies in the class. We also ask
              that you bring along a lead and collar for your puppy, as well as
              some treats to reward them for their good behaviour. We ask that
              you bring along a blanket or mat for your puppy to sit on during
              the class. This will help to create a comfortable and familiar
              space for your puppy. During week 2 we will be covering grooming
              so please bring a towel and a soft brush suitable for puppy coats.

              We offer 1-2-1 sessions for puppies and adult dogs. These sessions
              are tailored to your dog's individual needs and can be booked at a
              time that suits you. We can help with a range of issues, from
              basic obedience training to more complex behaviour problems. Our
              experienced trainers will work with you and your dog to develop a
              training plan that is right for you. We can also provide support
              and advice on a range of topics, including puppy socialisation,
              house training, and basic commands. Our 1-2-1 sessions are a great
              way to get the support and guidance you need to help your dog
              reach their full potential.

              We offer a range of one off and regular events throughout the
              year, including workshops, seminars, and socialisation days. These
              events are a great way to meet other dog owners and learn more
              about dog training and behaviour. Our events are designed to be
              fun and informative, and are suitable for dogs of all ages and
              experience levels. We also offer a range of activities for you and
              your dog to enjoy together, including agility, scent work, and
              obedience training. We ask that your dogs are not aggressive and
              you are able to keep good control over them throughout the session
              to avoid risk to other people and their pets.
